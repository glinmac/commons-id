/**
 * <p>{@link Clock} provides a timing mechanism for returning the current time in
 * 100-nano second intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582.</p>
 *
 * <p>This Class consumes a single thread which will die off if not utilized before
 * the expiration. Subsequent calls after a thread expires start a new thread.
 * Compensates for jvm time resolution issues. This clock should be used in
 * instances where the system resolution does not perform adequately - the
 * clocking resolution on some windows virtual machines can range from 10 to 50
 * milliseconds before the System.currentTimeMillis changes. In instances where
 * 10,000 or more uuid's may be generated in a millisecond this Clock
 * implementation may be required.</p>
