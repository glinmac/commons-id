/**
 * <p>Provides a timing mechanism for returning the current time in
 * 100-nano second intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582.</p>
 *
 * <p>As described below this is useful for generating Version 1 UUIDs</p>
 *
 * <p>See the <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc4122.txt">RFC 4122:
 * A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace</a>
 * for more information.</p>
 *
 * <p>Selected quotes from IETF document pertaining to this class:</p>
 *
 * <p>====================================================================</p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Timestamp</dt>
 * <dd>"The timestamp is a 60 bit value. For UUID version 1, this is
 * represented by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) as a count of 100-
 * nanosecond intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582 (the date of
 * Gregorian reform to the Christian calendar)."</dd>
 *
 * <dt>System Clock Resolution</dt>
 * <dd>"If a system overruns the generator by requesting too many UUIDs
 * within a single system time interval, the UUID service MUST either
 * return an error, or stall the UUID generator until the system clock
 * catches up.<br>
 * <br>
 * A high resolution timestamp can be simulated by keeping a count of
 * the number of UUIDs that have been generated with the same value of
 * the system time, and using it to construct the low order bits of the
 * timestamp.  The count will range between zero and the number of
 * 100-nanosecond intervals per system time interval.<br>
 * <br>
 * Note: If the processors overrun the UUID generation frequently,
 * additional node identifiers can be allocated to the system, which
 * will permit higher speed allocation by making multiple UUIDs
 * potentially available for each time stamp value."</dd>
